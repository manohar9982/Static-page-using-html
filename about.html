        Tourism is travel for pleasure or business, and the commercial activity of providing and supporting such travel
        The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, 
        in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", 
        as people "travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, 
        business and other purposes".
